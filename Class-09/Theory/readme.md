# Chapter 09 - Optimizing our App


## Theory Assignment:
## Q : When and why do we need `lazy()`?
- Lazy loading (also called on-demand loading) is an optimization technique for the online content, be it a website or a web app.
Instead of loading the entire web page and rendering it to the user in one go as in bulk loading, the concept of lazy loading assists in loading only the required section and delays the remaining, until it is needed by the user.



## Q : What is `suspense`?
- 'Suspense` lets you display a fallback until its children have finished loading.

```Usage```
âš« Displaying a fallback while content is loading
âš« Revealing content together at once
âš« Revealing nested content as it loads
âš« Showing stale content while fresh content is loading
âš« Preventing already revealed content from hiding
âš« Indicating that a transition is happening
âš« Resetting Suspense boundaries on navigation
âš« Providing a fallback for server errors and server-only content




## Q : Why we got this `error`: A component was suspended while responding to `synchronous input`. This will cause the `UI` to be replaced with a `loading indicator`. To `fix this`, `updates that suspend` should be wrapped with `start transition`? How does `suspense fix` this error?

## Q : When `do we and why do we need suspense`?
